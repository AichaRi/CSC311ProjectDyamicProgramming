Problem Statement 
Ahmad is a company manager, he intends to start a project that calls for forming project
teams. The company’s organizational structure is shown as a tree, where each node represents
an employee. Every employee possesses a specific level of skill. With the following limitations
in mind, the objective is to assemble project teams with the highest possible overall competence
level:
• Workers ought to be on a different team than their direct supervisor.
• A broad skill set is required for every project team; this is the total difference between
the team’s highest and lowest skill levels.
• Each project team’s size should be restricted to a given maximum.
Describe two algorithms to find the optimal combination of project teams that:
• Maximizes the total skill level.
• Respects the constraint that no employee is part of the same team as their immediate
superior.
• Maximizes overall board skills across all teams.
• Ensures that each team does not exceed the specified maximum size.
